      "Demaree Services is available to us (via voicemail and pager) 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Whenever a problem has arisen, they have responded in a timely manner. We have found that many of our maintenance problems and repairs can be taken care of by Demaree Services without the hiring of an outside vendor. When it is necessary for an outside vendor to come in, Demaree Services has demonstrated its ability to hire competent people at reasonable prices. They are very cost-conscious when they look for outside assistance."

Not only are they extraordinarily competent, they are remarkably responsive and patient when fielding our service requests.
